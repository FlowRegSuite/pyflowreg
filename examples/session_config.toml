# Example session configuration file for PyFlowReg multi-recording processing
# Copy and modify this file for your experiment

# === Data Location ===
# NOTE: Use forward slashes (/) for paths, even on Windows
# OR use double backslashes (\\) on Windows: "C:\\Users\\name\\experiment\\"
root = "/path/to/your/experiment/"  # Directory containing recordings
pattern = "*.tif"                   # File pattern to match recordings

# Optional: Specify which recording to use as reference
# If not specified, the lexicographic middle file is used
# center = "recording_005.tif"

# === Output Paths ===
# These can be absolute or relative to root
output_root = "compensated_outputs"  # Stage 1 outputs (per-recording)
final_results = "final_results"      # Stage 2-3 outputs (session-wide)

# === Processing Options ===
resume = true                         # Skip completed steps on rerun
scheduler = "local"                   # Options: "local", "array", "dask"

# === Optical Flow Backend ===
# Choose the backend for displacement computation

# === Stage 2 Alignment Parameters ===
# These control inter-sequence registration quality

# Phase cross-correlation initialization
cc_upsample = 4                       # Subpixel accuracy (higher = more precise)

# Gaussian smoothing before alignment
sigma_smooth = 6.0                    # Sigma for Gaussian filter

# Optical flow refinement
alpha_between = 25.0                  # Regularization strength (higher = smoother)
iterations_between = 100              # Solver iterations (higher = more accurate)

# === Stage 1 Options (Optional) ===
# Override specific parameters for per-recording motion correction
# These are passed to OFOptions in run_stage1()
#
# [of_options_override]
# quality_setting = "balanced"        # Options: "fast", "balanced", "quality"
